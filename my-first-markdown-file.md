# Hello Markdown!

It is **sooo** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hang of *it*, you just:

* Remember the basic syntax
* Write the doc
* Done!

Now you can be a Wix at this language and code stuff like `console.writeline("Hello Markdown!");`

Can't remember the language! No problem! Just visit one of these resources:
